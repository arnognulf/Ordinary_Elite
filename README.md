Ordinary Elite
==============

Ordinary Elite is based on the excellent Special Elite by Astigmatic, but with changed metrics so it can be used as a programming font and in terminal emulators as well.


Original text about "Special Elite":


"About Special Elite

Special Elite mimics the Smith Corona Special Elite Type Number NR6 and Remington Noiseless typewriter models.

A little bit of inked up grunge and a little old school analog flavor work together to give you a vintage typewriter typeface for your website and designs."

Original typeface at: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Special+Elite


Please dont bug Astigmatic of botched metrics or other issues with this modification.
