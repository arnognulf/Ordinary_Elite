* Remove fi and fl ligatures.
* M is the widest US-ASCII character at 1429, therefore we set ALL letters to this width (yes, OE is at 2085, but I don't speak that letter).
  in order for a typeface to be monospace, all the letters needs to be exactly the same width.
* In order for apostrophes and umlauts to not get dislocated, all glyph references are unlinked (yes there is probably a better way. beats me).
* Center in width.
* Rename.
